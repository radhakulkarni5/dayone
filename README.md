learnings about github and licenses 
## Github introduction
1.We have learnt that Github is an internet hosting service for software development and version control using git .
2.we learnt about the features like git commit,git push, pull requests.
3.we created our own repositories and learnt about main and branches.
4.we learnt about the features like fork and clones ,revert.
## Licences
1.MIT Licenses: A short and simple permissive licenses with conditions only requiring preservation of copyright and license notices 
2.Apache Licenses:same as MIT but with more words . great for lawyers.
3.GPL : this is the heaviest licenses . it's a copyleft license
4.we need licenses , so that we can officialy use their codes .
Thank You
